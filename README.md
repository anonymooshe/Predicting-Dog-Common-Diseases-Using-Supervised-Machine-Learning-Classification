# Predicting Dog Common Diseases Using Supervised Machine Learning Classification
 A Capstone Presented to the Department of Data Science, College of Information Technology and Computing, University of Science and Technology of Southern Philippines, Cagayan de Oro City.  This study developed a Supervised Machine Learning Classification Application to predict Common Dog Diseases, aiding pet owners in managing their pets' health. The research focused on identifying prevalent dog diseases and symptoms from a local veterinary clinic dataset in Cagayan de Oro City. Data preprocessing reduced the dataset to match local diseases. The study used physical symptoms recognizable by pet owners, focusing on home use.  The machine learning models (k-NN, Support Vector Machine, Naive Bayes) achieved high accuracy (up to 95%). Ensemble methods further improved accuracy to an average of 95%. SHAP was used for visualizing essential symptom-related factors for diseases. The study introduced a prognosis measure for recovery chances based on symptoms. Accuracy varied across disease classes due to data quality and quantity.  The study underscores data selection's impact on model performance, suggesting collaboration with veterinary experts for future work. Recommendations include expanding the dataset, adding demographic/environmental features, and deploying the web application online for community benefit.
